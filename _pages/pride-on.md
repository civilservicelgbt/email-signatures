Use this tool to create a signature you can put in your emails for Pride season.

1. **Choose a style of signature.** Choose your colours and message.
2. **Choose a signature output.** Some email clients support “parsed” email signatures and some require you to paste plain “HTML”. Try both and see which one works best.
3. **Copy signature.** Use the button to copy the correct output to your clipboard. You can also manually select the relevant out in the preview on the right hand side.

**Please note:** this won't work with every email client. If it doesn't work for you, sorry about that!
