  Civil Service LGBT+ Network volunteers can use this tool to generate an email signature.

  1. **Choose a style of signature.** The default signature is the one you should use most of the time. The Pride On format is for use when we are advertising our annual pride events.
  2. **Enter your details.** Include your name, role, phone number and email address. The preview will update automatically.
  3. **Choose a signature output.** Some email clients support “parsed” email signatures and some require you to paste plain “HTML”. Try both and see which one works best.
  4. **Copy signature.** Use the button to copy the correct output to your clipboard. You can also manually select the relevant out in the preview on the right hand side.
